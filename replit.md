## System Architecture
The application employs a full-stack architecture with distinct frontend and backend components.

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript.
- **Vite** for build processes.
- **Tailwind CSS** with **shadcn/ui** for design.
- **Wouter** for client-side routing.
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching.
- **Recharts** for data visualization.

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** with TypeScript for API services.
- **PostgreSQL** with **Drizzle ORM**.
- Integration with College Football Data API and Reddit API.
- RESTful API design.

### Database Design
Key tables include `Teams`, `Games`, `Predictions`, `Sentiment Analysis`, `Users`, `Players`, `PlayerStats`, `Injuries`, `PlayerImpactAnalysis`, and `KeyPlayerMatchups`.

### Technical Implementations & Features
- **Data Management**: Automated real-time and historical data synchronization from College Football Data API (2009-2024 seasons), including data cleaning and validation.
- **Analytics Engine**: Advanced prediction algorithm incorporating ELO ratings, weather analysis, travel distance penalties, conference performance patterns, and natural language processing for Reddit r/CFB community sentiment.
- **Statistical Player Analysis**: Python-based historical analysis generating statistically-proven player impact coefficients.
- **User Interface**: Responsive design with interactive charts, detailed game cards, advanced filtering, "Game of the Week," and a comprehensive game analysis dashboard.
- **Prediction System**: Dual system displaying Rick's personal picks and algorithmic predictions, with an admin panel.
- **Player & Injury Tracking**: Comprehensive system for collecting player data, tracking injuries, and analyzing player impact.
- **Real-Time Handicapping Engine**: TypeScript implementation applying Python-derived coefficients to live player data.
- **Betting Line System**: Automated three-tier betting line refresh schedule.
- **Head-to-Head History**: Detailed historical matchup analysis.
- **International Game Support**: Automatic detection and flag display for games played outside the USA, with proper venue information.
- **FAQ and Legal Compliance**: Comprehensive FAQ with disclaimers about entertainment purposes and algorithm transparency.
- **Algorithm Enhancements**: Integration of SP+ ratings, player efficiency analytics, team efficiency differentials, and momentum analysis to target improved ATS accuracy.
- **Unified Prediction System**: Centralized prediction logic using `ricksPicksEngine` for platform-wide consistency, moving calculations server-side.
- **Neutral Site & International Game Detection**: Algorithm to identify and correctly handle neutral site games, including international venues, in prediction calculations.
- **Reddit Sentiment Integration**: Replaced Twitter API with Reddit r/CFB community integration for sentiment analysis, utilizing weighted scoring based on upvotes and post scores.
- **Admin Security System**: Comprehensive authentication middleware protecting all administrative endpoints (data sync, team updates, historical collection) with Bearer token authentication.
- **Team Logo Fallback System**: Professional American football helmet SVG graphics with team abbreviations automatically replace broken ESPN CDN logos to eliminate 400 errors and maintain visual consistency.
- **Unified Prediction Consistency**: Centralized prediction logic ensures identical recommendations across all UI components (green badges, recommendation tabs, API endpoints) with comprehensive integration testing to prevent display inconsistencies.
- **Critical Betting Logic Fix (Aug 2025)**: Resolved betting recommendation engine bug where significant edges (5+ points) showed "No Strong Edge". Fixed edge calculation to properly handle opposite-side predictions by adding magnitudes instead of subtracting, enabling proper identification of valuable betting opportunities.
- **Database Integrity Cleanup (Aug 2025)**: Removed 2,772 duplicate and invalid game entries (including 45 duplicate Montana State vs Idaho games) to eliminate frontend display issues and ensure clean data presentation.
- **Component Consolidation (Aug 7, 2025)**: Merged duplicate `ImprovedHistoricalGameCard` into `HistoricalGameCard` with enhanced features including helmet logo fallback system, TypeScript safety improvements, and production-ready error handling. Fixed Docker build export issue by adding both named and default exports. Files modified: `client/src/components/historical-game-card.tsx` (replaced with dual exports), `client/src/pages/historical.tsx` (import updated), deleted duplicate components and temporary files.
- **Critical Betting Logic Fix & Test Framework (Aug 7, 2025)**: Fixed major bug where underdog value bets showed "Analysis Pending" instead of proper recommendations. Created comprehensive `betting-logic-test.ts` regression test suite covering all betting scenarios (opposite sides, same side stronger/weaker, underdog value, edge cases). Test framework validates 8 critical scenarios and blocks deployment if betting logic fails. Added `test-betting-logic.sh` executable script for easy testing during development. Algorithm now correctly identifies underdog value when Vegas has larger spreads than our predictions on the same side.
- **Multi-Source Sentiment Analysis System (Aug 9, 2025)**: Built comprehensive sentiment analysis system targeting ESPN, 247Sports, Twitter/X, and sports news outlets. Features advanced aggregation engine with confidence scoring, source weighting, and professional frontend interface with interactive tabs. Added new API endpoints for both individual source analysis (`/api/sentiment/espn/:team`) and combined multi-source insights (`/api/sentiment/multi-source/:team`). Integrated "Multi-Source" navigation link in header menu. System provides weighted overall sentiment scores with detailed source-specific breakdowns for enhanced college football team analysis.
- **August-9 Branch Deployment Merge (Aug 9, 2025)**: Successfully merged main branch deployment infrastructure into august-9 development branch. Updated Dockerfile to use proper multi-stage build process, created database initialization script, and preserved all multi-source sentiment analysis features. Resolved 133+ file conflicts by accepting deployment changes from main while maintaining development functionality. Branch now production-ready with both deployment infrastructure and new sentiment analysis capabilities.
