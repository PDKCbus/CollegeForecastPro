## Development Guidelines

**Data Collection Pattern:**
- Historical collection complete - use `weekly-2025-collector.ts` for ongoing 2025 season maintenance  
- Tuesday morning schedule recommended to catch Monday holiday games
- **Weather enrichment integrated**: Weekly collector now updates weather data for games within 7 days
- Weather APIs provide forecast data for games 1-7 days out, ensuring Rick's Picks has real weather factors
- Processes seasons in smaller batches (25 games) with 2-second delays to avoid timeouts
- Includes retry logic for CFBD API requests (up to 3 attempts per request)
- 30-second timeout per individual API request with graceful failure handling
- Comprehensive weather generation and betting line integration with DraftKings > Bovada priority
- **Weather Analysis Dataset**: 2015-2024 seasons (10 years) provide reliable venue data for weather hypothesis testing
- **CFBD Data Quality**: Pre-2015 seasons have limited coverage and unreliable venue mapping, unsuitable for weather analysis
- **COMPLETE 15-YEAR DATASET**: All 16 seasons (2009-2024) collected with 28,458 games and 10,136 betting lines (duplicates cleaned)
- **Weather Analysis Ready**: 2015-2024 seasons provide reliable venue data for comprehensive hypothesis testing  
- **Database Quality**: Fixed dome detection, venue naming, and API field mapping across all eras
