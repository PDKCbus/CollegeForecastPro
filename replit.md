## Development Guidelines

**Data Collection Pattern:**
- Historical collection complete - use `weekly-2025-collector.ts` for ongoing 2025 season maintenance  
- **AUTOMATED BETTING LINE REFRESH SYSTEM**: Three-tier schedule for optimal prediction accuracy
  - **Tuesday 7:00 AM**: Full weekly collection (new games + weather + betting lines)
  - **Thursday 8:00 AM**: Mid-week line refresh (capture early week movement)
  - **Saturday 9:00 AM**: Pre-game line refresh (capture final movements before kickoff)
- **Mid-Week Line Tracking**: System detects significant line movement (‚â•0.5 points) and logs major shifts
- **Weather enrichment integrated**: Weekly collector now updates weather data for games within 7 days
- Weather APIs provide forecast data for games 1-7 days out, ensuring Rick's Picks has real weather factors
- Processes seasons in smaller batches (25 games) with 2-second delays to avoid timeouts
- Includes retry logic for CFBD API requests (up to 3 attempts per request)
- 30-second timeout per individual API request with graceful failure handling
- Comprehensive weather generation and betting line integration with DraftKings > Bovada priority
- **Weather Analysis Dataset**: 2015-2024 seasons (10 years) provide reliable venue data for weather hypothesis testing
- **CFBD Data Quality**: Pre-2015 seasons have limited coverage and unreliable venue mapping, unsuitable for weather analysis
