# Rick's Picks - College Football Analytics Platform

## Overview

Rick's Picks is a comprehensive college football analytics platform that provides advanced statistics, predictions, and social sentiment analysis for college football games. The application combines real-time data from the College Football Data API with sophisticated analytics to deliver actionable insights for college football enthusiasts.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and modern development
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS** with **shadcn/ui** components for consistent, accessible UI design

- **TanStack Query** for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- **Recharts** for data visualization and analytics charts

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript for API endpoints
- **PostgreSQL** database for persistent data storage
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations and migrations
- **College Football Data API** integration for real-time game data
- **Twitter API** integration for social sentiment analysis
- RESTful API design with proper error handling and logging

### Database Design
- **Teams table**: Stores team information including logos, conferences, and records
- **Games table**: Central table for game data with betting lines and scores

## Development Guidelines

**Data Collection Pattern:**
- Use existing proven components: `comprehensive-data-sync.ts`, `raw-pg-storage.ts`, `data-cleaner.ts`
- Leverage established API endpoints: `/api/comprehensive/sync-missing`, `/api/comprehensive/sync-season/:year`
- Avoid creating bespoke sync scripts - extend existing classes instead
- Current sync progress: Missing years (2018, 2019, 2021-2023) in progress via comprehensive sync
