## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Admin UI preferences: Simple button interface for spread/over-under picks instead of complex form fields.
Branding preference: "ðŸ¤“ ANALYSIS PICK" over "ðŸ¤– ALGORITHM PICK" for algorithmic predictions.
Footer navigation: Remove unnecessary links (How It Works, Betting Guide), link College Football Stats to collegefootballdata.com.

## System Architecture
The application employs a full-stack architecture with distinct frontend and backend components.

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for robust UI development.
- **Vite** for efficient build processes and fast development.
- **Tailwind CSS** with **shadcn/ui** for a consistent and accessible design system.
- **Wouter** for client-side routing.
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching and state management.
- **Recharts** for data visualization.

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** with TypeScript for API services.
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary data store, managed with **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe operations.
- Integration with the **College Football Data API** for real-time game data and **Twitter API** for social sentiment.
- RESTful API design with comprehensive error handling.

### Database Design
Key tables include:
- `Teams`: Stores team details.
- `Games`: Core game data, including betting lines and scores.
- `Predictions`: Rick's generated predictions.
- `Sentiment Analysis`: Twitter sentiment data.
- `Users`: For authentication and profile management.

- **Player & Injury Tracking**: Comprehensive system for collecting player data, tracking injuries, and analyzing player impact on game outcomes, integrated into the handicapping engine with historical statistical backing.
- **Real-Time Handicapping Engine**: TypeScript implementation applies Python-derived coefficients to live player data, calculating QB vs Defense matchups, injury impacts, and position-specific value ratings.
- **Betting Line System**: Automated three-tier betting line refresh schedule (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday) to ensure predictions use the freshest data. Includes spread formatting to industry standards.
- **Head-to-Head History**: Provides detailed historical matchup analysis between teams from the 15-year dataset.
- **International Game Support**: Automatic detection and flag display for games played outside the USA, including proper venue information for international locations like Ireland, England, Germany, and Mexico.
- **FAQ and Legal Compliance**: Comprehensive FAQ section with proper disclaimers about entertainment purposes, algorithm performance transparency (51.7% ATS), and no guaranteed results.
- **Algorithm Research Framework**: Advanced metrics research completed including CFBD API endpoint analysis for SP+ ratings, player PPA/EPA data, team efficiency metrics, and coaching records.
- **Data Sync Logging System**: Simplified logging system tracking auto-sync events and major data operations with timestamps in `/logs/data_sync_log.txt` (excludes individual API requests for cleaner logs).
