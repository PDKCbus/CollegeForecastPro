- **Sample Size**: ~300 games total
- **Data Coverage**: 2 seasons only
- **Statistical Confidence**: Limited due to small sample

### Expanded Backtesting Implementation

#### **Comprehensive Historical Coverage (2009-2024)**
- **Total Games Available**: 15+ years of college football data
- **Estimated Sample Size**: 15,000+ completed games with betting lines
- **Season Coverage**: 16 complete seasons (2009-2024)

#### **Enhanced Backtesting Features**
1. **Season-by-Season Analysis**: Performance metrics for each individual season
2. **Era Comparison**: Pre-playoff vs playoff era performance analysis
3. **Trend Analysis**: Identification of improving/declining performance years
4. **Context Awareness**: Each season tagged with historical context (championship runs, COVID impact, etc.)
5. **Statistical Confidence**: Much higher confidence with 50x larger sample size

#### **Performance Metrics Tracked**
- Against The Spread (ATS) percentage by season
- Average prediction error vs Vegas lines
- Win/loss records for algorithm predictions
- Comparison with Vegas accuracy
- Confidence levels based on sample sizes
